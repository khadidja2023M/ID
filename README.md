# National ID Card Recognition
![images_id](https://github.com/khadidja2023M/ID/assets/123754339/05f4e0b3-e1b3-426d-8a6d-8da2fd8d2409)
In this project, I used OCR to perform National ID Card Recognition. I employed Tesseract OCR, an open-source OCR engine, to recognize the text on the ID card images. Additionally, I utilized OpenCV, an open-source computer vision library, to preprocess the images before passing them to the OCR engine.
